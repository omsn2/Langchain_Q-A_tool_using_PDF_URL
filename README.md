## Project Title
**Langchain_Q-A_tool_using_PDF_URL
**

## Introduction
This project contains multiple Python scripts that likely perform specific tasks related to FAISS indexing and other operations. It includes modular components for testing, resource handling, and indexing.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`, `app2.py`, `app3.py`: Core scripts for running different parts of the application.
- `test.py`: Script for testing the application functionality.
- `assets/`: Directory containing static resources.
- `faiss_index`: Directory likely containing precomputed FAISS index data.
- `.env`: Environment variables file (excluded from version control).


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omsn2/Langchain_Q-A_tool_using_PDF_URL.git
   cd Langchain_Q-A_tool_using_PDF_URL
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file for environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your environment-specific variables.

## Usage
1. Run the main application (assuming `app.py` is the entry point):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

## Features
- FAISS-based indexing.
- Modular structure with multiple application entry points.
- Testing functionality included.
